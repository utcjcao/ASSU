The past two years on ASSU, as Executive and Treasurer, have been tremendously rewarding, and I am beyond grateful to serve the student community once again. \n\n I look forward to advancing initiatives in consultation with the Office of the Dean, maintaining extended library hours during final exam periods, ensuring smooth progress of core ASSU events (Arbor Journal, URC, Open Mic Night), and helping students during my office hours. When not at the ASSU office, you can find me at case competitions, a research lab, or exploring Toronto with BikeShare. \n It's always a delight to meet new people ‚Äì reach out or swing by the office!",

My favourite part about working in ASSU is being able to translate student needs into policy changes, programs, events, and more. Please never hesitate to reach out to me with concerns, feedback, ideas, or just to chat! Every student I have spoken to during my past year on ASSU has shown me that I am surrounded by a beautiful community at UofT. \n\n I hope to increase accessibility and inclusivity in A&S by making mentoring services for graduate applicants freely available, discussing with admin, faculty, staff, and students how to reduce systemic discrimination in the classroom and on campus, and standardizing more academic practices.",
